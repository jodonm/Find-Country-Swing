# Find-Country-Swing

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my Find Country Swing project! This Django-based application is designed to help users discover places to enjoy country swing dancing. Whether you're a seasoned dancer or new to the scene, Find Country Swing aims to connect you with venues, events, and communities dedicated to country swing.

I created this website as a way to for me to learn the Django platform and develop my skills in web design, database managment, and python logic. This was primarily a hobby project but I hope that it is useful for others who enjoy country swing dance.
