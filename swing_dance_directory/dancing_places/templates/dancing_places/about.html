    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hey everyone! Welcome to Find Country Swing!</p>
    <p>This website is a tool to help country swing dancers find venues with country music, a good atmosphere, and a dancing crowd. </p>
    <p>My wife and I met at a local dance hall and have shared country swing dancing as a hobby ever since. Swing dancing has become such a large part of our lives that we end up searching for dancing spots any time we travel. Sometimes we travel for the sole purpose of trying out a new place!</p>
    <p>Finding places with a good country swing crowd can be difficult. In the past, our methods have included digging through Google reviews, searching old Facebook posts, and even stalking other dancer's Instagram accounts. I built this website as a solution to that problem.</p>
    <p>I hope this site helps save others time, and maybe even helps you discover a new favorite spot! </p>
    <p>Happy Dancing!</p>
